### Working as .py file but needs downloaded data (downloaded data should be in the folder with it)
-Comoving (data: all_columns_catalog.fits.gz) ISSUE: doing a query requires some fixes to the el_badry files
-globularstars (data: clusters folder)
-stellarclusters (data: UCC_cat.csv.gz)


### Converted to .py files, still working out some kinks
-dr3rv ISSUE: Memory error in trying to read the fits file. 
                This may work on a more powerful machine, as querying gaia using TOP 1000 makes it all work.



to do list:
-dr3rv currently downloading, test it once it's downloaded
-comoving make sure the query works (all_columns_catalog.fitz.gz)
-make sure everything is well commented, add my name to things
