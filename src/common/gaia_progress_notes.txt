### Working as .py file but needs downloaded data (downloaded data should be in the folder with it)
-Comoving (data: all_columns_catalog.fits.gz) ISSUE: doing a query requires some fixes to the el_badry files
-globularstars (data: clusters.zip and globclusters.csv)
-stellarclusters (data: UCC_cat.csv.gz)

### Converted to .py files, still working out some kinks
-dr3rv ISSUE: Memory error in trying to read the fits file. 
                This may work on a more powerful machine, as querying gaia using TOP 1000 makes it all work.
-giants ISSUE: I get a "not enough memory" error when trying to create the csv, speck, and asset files
                it may work on a more powerful machine, as the code works if i do data[:1000]


### Successfully generate asset files
